# Open AI Case Study 

## Breif Overview , Beginnings , Mission Statement 

* Open AI (About. (n.d.). https://openai.com/about/) 

* Open AI was founded on December 11, 2015 (Wikimedia Foundation. (2024, June 7). OpenAI. Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI )

* The founders of Open AI are [Ilya Sutskever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilya_Sutskever),[Greg Brockman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Brockman),[Trevor Blackwell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Blackwell),[Vicki Cheung],[Andrej Karpathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrej_Karpathy),[Durk Kingma],[Jessica Livingston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Livingston),[John Schulman],[Pamela Vagata],[Wojciech Zaremba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Zaremba),[Sam Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman),[Elon Musk] ~(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk) (Wikimedia Foundation. (2024, June 7). OpenAI. Wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI )

* "OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company. Our mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity." ~(About. (n.d.). https://openai.com/about/) 
  The founders of Open AI wanted to ensure that Ai was being created thoughtfully and carefully throughout the entire process.  

* Open AI at its infancy was a non-profit organization that was pleged over 1 Billion. Open AI moved from the non-profit organization to a for-profit organization in 2019 and is in a partnership with Microsoft. The funding recieved to date seems unclear but they have recieved substantial amounts during their non-profit operation years in the neighborhood of 130 Million. ~(Our structure.

## Business 

* I believe they are trying to excellerate the improvement and development of most things known to man and help discover unknowns by creating a AGI that is generally smarter than humans. By doing this they will improve all of mankind by new technologies and improvements over the current technogies at hand.  ~(About. (n.d.). https://openai.com/about/)

* Open Ai is targeting everyone as a customer, whether you are a college student/ stay at home parent/ or a nationally known company Open AI seems to have a product or service to help you. Chat GPT can be placed on an individuals personal device via an application or web based page. Their Ai model can improve professionnals in a coding course creating a new application while making their work more effeicient. 

* Open Ai's advantage is that they are leading the way in the market in AI software. They were one of the first companies in this space and it shows as they have only comtinued to imporve their model.   ~(08, A., Bowman, J., & The Motley Fool Founded in 1993 in Alexandria. (n.d.).

* I never really utilized stackshare and was unsure how to utilize the data given to me. If I am reading it correctly they seem to be integrated into several services including but not limited to: Cloudflare, Amazon Web Services, Amazon CloudFront, and Prism.  ~(Openai.com - OpenAI Tech Stack.

## Specs 

* Programing,Engineering, and training Artificial Intelligence is what Open Ai is in the business of doing. They have been at it since December 11th 2015 and still going strong with their recent announcement of being added into the IOS/MACOS and IPADOS software on Apples lineup in IOS 18 updates. It seems Siri will act as a layer over the top of Chat GPT giving Siri more function. They are also adding an Emoji creater, Image generator, and other cool features.  ~(Apple WWDC 2024: AI, IOS 18 and more in less than six minutes: WSJ. YouTube.

* Open Ai has a few competitiors, Optimole whom has 65.91% Market share, ARKit with 3.62% Market Share, and Google AI with 3.12% Market Share.  ~(OpenAI - market share, competitor insights in Artificial Intelligence. 6sense.

## Results

* Open Ai has made a momunmental impact on the Ai Buinsess model by impacting the industry to move into ethical development of AI. This not only impacts the Ai of today but future Ai models and means we create with intent versus to create just to create.  ~(Kapa, M. (2024, February 20).

* Other Than Market Share Ai comapnies are also measured by their abilities to complete tasks as well as how their Ai models compare to those on the market. Comparison could mean memory retention or how many of lines of intrusctions it can be given and still complete it effectively or deliver data effeicently. Open Ai's models have a high level of accuracy, can be scaled up quickly depending on business needs, and it has fast processing speeds.  ~(OpenAI models vs. other NLP models: Which One is the best?.

## Recommendations

* I believe something Chat GPT could do for us currently is wait in line on a phone call in the background on your phone. Instead of wasting all that time on hold they can communicate with the individual giving all the necessary data to them by asking you what it will need before the person on the other side of the line asks for it. If there is ever an issue it can then place a phone call to you to answer and resolve all while cutting out all the uneccessary time on the phone. 

Another use case I can see it completing is 911. Right now 911 is seeing higher call volumes more than ever. dispatchers cannot keep up and 911 coms centers are rated at the length of time it takes them to pick up a call and help the other person on the line. One issue I find with 911 is data transfer being done effeicntly. People are frantic when they call 911 and can barely get out the neccessary information for first responders to start heading in there direction. I think that Open Ai could create something of a 911 bot that can pick up 911 calls faster than a dispatcher would be able to and very quickly ask the caller if their location is correct and what they are calling about. this will give a gap of time for a dispatcher to connect to the call but less time an individual is waiting on the phone. This could also creat an prompt on 911's side to then give to first responders right away. Instead of typing this information in it would auto generate and could be pushed out to the neccessary first responders. 

* Not only would this show the community the positive impact Ai can have on the community but it also shows the usefullness and utility of Ai. For Open AI who could be a better customer than the Government? $$$

* The technologies they currently invest in, I suppose they would to make sure that Open AI would communicate with the current software in place by the municipalities but i assume a third party application could be created so they could all understand each other. 

* I think my product could function fine without the integration of a third party application that communicated to the current software. I also believe it would be a mistake not to invest in moving forward with an application that can do this as it would greatly imporve turnaround time and open the door for greater Ai integration down the road further expanding the expodential curve of the usefulness and desire of the product being used by other municiplaities (R&D if you will).
